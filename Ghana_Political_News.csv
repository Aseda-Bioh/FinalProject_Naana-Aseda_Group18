Bawku volatility is partly caused by NPP – Mahama Ayariga,"Politics of Sunday,  4 August 2024","Mahama Ayarigahas attributed part of the volatility in Bawku to the actions of the New Patriotic Party (NPP).Speaking to Accra-based Woezor Television in Bolgatanga, Ayariga expressed his concerns about the situation.He blamed the Minister of National Security, Albert Kan-Dapaah for not being able to resolve the dispute despite the promises by the government.""As the people of Bawku are grappling with insecurity, which I believe was largely created by the promises of the NPP to my people. The report that I have indicates from a very credible source that the Minister of National Security is given GH¢18 million every quarter in the name of dealing with the security problem,"" Ayariga said.He added, ""He gets a cheque of GH¢6million in the name of dealing with the Bawku problem while the people of Bawku are wallowing in poverty, are sleeping under curfew, and as a result of a situation created by their misrepresentation to my people, they sign a fat cheque of GH¢6million and take it home in the name of dealing with the problem.""","Yes, tension flares in Bawku anytime NPP comes to power. Chieftaincy disputes in the Northern and Upper East often heighten anytime NPP is in power because of the belief that the party provides cover for such certain chieftaincy gates. Take the gruesome and unfortunate murder of the Ya Naa for example. There was absolute peace until NPP surfaced"
Resist NPP’s GH¢200 and GH¢500 bribe during elections – Mahama to youth,"Politics of Sunday,  4 August 2024","The presidential candidate for the National Democratic Congress (NDC),John Dramani Mahamahas called on the youth and students of the Tempane Constituency to resist any attempts by theNew Patriotic Party(NPP) to sway their votes with monetary incentives.Speaking to the students and party supporters at the Tempane Senior High School during his national campaign tour, Mr. Mahama urged the young electorate not to let their votes be bought with sums of GH¢200 or GH¢500, warning that such inducements would only perpetuate their poverty.""Don't let NPP buy your conscience with GH¢200 or GH¢500 during elections to continue to keep you in poverty,"" Mr Mahama asserted.""If they come with the money, collect it and chop it, it is your money, but don't vote for them because NPP doesn't have anything better to offer your future,"" he said.In his speech, Mr Mahama emphasised that accepting bribes from the NPP would not lead to any substantial improvement in their lives or the country's development.Instead, he encouraged them to look beyond short-term gains and focus on the long-term benefits of voting for a party that genuinely cares about their future.The former President also took the opportunity to criticize the NPP's presidential candidate, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, suggesting a lack of consistency and reliability in their policies.He questioned the candidate's shift in focus from economic issues to digitalisation, implying that this change signaled a lack of concrete plans for the nation's economic recovery.""If I say the NPP has nothing to offer for the future of Ghanaians, I mean it because the very 'Mr. Economy' who was all over saying micro and macroeconomics is now running away from that to something called digitalisation,"" Mahama argued.""Is this the type of person you should trust? Let us rescue this country together through your vote for the NDC,"" he said.The Tempane Constituency event is part of Mahama's extensive efforts to engage with the electorates and garner support ahead of the upcoming elections.He further assured the people of continuing some of the projects that were started under his reign but got abandoned by the current government especially the road network in the area.","We can't maintain NPP for another 4yrs. Dr Bawumia is a joke. He is just not the right person to lead the country at this moment. When the economy was been run down Ken Ofori Atta, he was mute. Mahama is not convincing me that he is the right alternative. Both presidential candidates are giving promises when they know the country is broke so instead of hitting on how they will bring the economy back from the ICU, they are still preaching the same old campaign tunes, spending spending spending, so does it mean borrowing, borrowing, borrowing? Because there is no money to spend on their promises. To me Mahama can win if he will convince us that he is patriotic and will be very radical about putting Ghana democracy back on track because he doesn't need another 4yrs and therefore will implement what will change the country political landscape forever. Even if he doesn't change the economic hardship but be bold enough to implement things like separation of Attorney General department and Ministry of Justice, make constitutional amendments to detach the executive from the legislature, independent appointment of Auditor General, IGP etc and the security top positions, cancelled political appointment of state own enterprises by advertising positions, cancel formation of board members of all institutions, decentralised government workers salary payment from the consolidated fund so that workers get paid according to what their own outputs, cut wastage with incentives for ministers, Senior government officials, government control of official vehicles must be considered and many others. We need change, the change can be painful but it will be worth it, jailed all people causing financial loss to the state to serve as deterrant with hard labour. Unless we approach the next four years with radical change this country won't be back to its glory. We need radical changes to make Ghana great again. We need to change from top to down. Every facet of society needs change. We can't continue with the status quo. It will be painful but at the end will be worth it. Wastage and corruption is the main problem facing Ghana and we need a leader who can put his foot down. A leader who doesn't serve political party but Ghanaians!"
National security ministry takes GH¢18m to deal with Bawku conflict quarterly - Ayariga alleges,"Politics of Sunday,  4 August 2024","Mahama Ayariga, the Member of Parliament for Bawku Central, has claimed that the Ministry of Finance gives the Ministry of National Security about GH¢6million a month to handle the Bawku issue.According to Ayariga, this amounts to GH¢18million every quarter.Speaking on Woezor TV on Saturday, August 3, 2024,Mahama Ayarigastated that there is no proof of work being done in spite of the enormous amount of money allotted to the ministry.He then challenged the National security minister,Albert Kan-Dapaahto answer his accusations.""If it is not true, he should come out publicly and tell me that it is not true and I will show him the records that every quarter that this conflict has been going on, he takes 18 million Ghana cedis. This is scandalous, this is unfair, and inappropriate and the people of Bawku should know this.""The people should know that the NPP government through its national security sinister signs a cheque of 6 million Ghana cedis every month, 18 million every quarter is given to them by the Ministry of Finance in the name of solving their problems. But how have they solved that problem? The problem has not been solved,""Mahama Ayarigasaid, as reported by myjoyonline.com.According to the former Minister of Youth and Sports, John Dramani Mahama of theNational Democratic Congress(NDC) was unable to visit the town while on a tour of the area due to the unrest in the area.He claimed that the youth's destruction of posters was an expression of their rage over John Mahama's choice to avoid the area on the advice of security experts.""Even yesterday, John Dramani Mahama could not drive through the town. If you noticed, we had to bypass the town because many of the youth wanted to follow him on the tour, and he could not drive through the town with them for fear that anything could happen to anybody.""The same way my uncle had difficulties in attending the rally and so they demanded that John Dramani Mahama should come to them and yet the security situation was not promising and everybody was growing cold feet. We didn't want to trigger anything and so when we decided not to pass through the town, you noticed that yesterday, they were very bitter and posters of mine and John Mahama were being burnt. It was because of the security situation and the fact that security experts advised us not to take the risk. It is painful and it hurts.""But while all this is going on, the national security minister signs a cheque of 6 million Ghana cedis every month in the name of dealing with the Bawku security problem,"" he emphasized.KA/AE",SO IN DEED THESE AKUFO ADDO AND THE NPPs REALLY WANT TO BURRY GHANA?

I’ll complete all abandoned projects by Akufo-Addo – Mahama reiterates,"Politics of Sunday,  4 August 2024","Flagbearer of theNational Democratic Congress(NDC),John Dramani Mahama, has promised to complete all abandoned projects by the Akufo-Addo-led administration.He was worried that the Akufo-Addo-Bawumia government had abandoned several projects initiated during his administration.Addressing chiefs and queen mothers at the Bawku Naba Palace in the Upper East Region, Mr. Mahama said his new administration will complete all abandoned projects under the NPP.He mentioned the Garu hospital, which has been abandoned since 2015, and the Bolga-Bawku-Pulmakom road.Mr. Mahama also commented on the Eastern Corridor project, initiated by Prof. Mills and continued by his government, but still incomplete.He added that the Tamne irrigation project will bring 3000 hectares of land under irrigation, benefiting four districts and enabling young people to engage in dry-season gardening and all-year-round farming.“There have been many issues that have been raised by Bawku Naba, one is the government hospital. There’s a hospital we were building in Garu, which unfortunately has been abandoned, I can assure the people of Garu that when we come, we’ll continue and finish that hospital so that they can have access to modern health facilities. there are many projects that we were working on that unfortunately have stalled,” he said.""I remember I cut a sod for the start of Bolga-Bawku-Pulmakom road sometime in 2015, we expected that that road would have been completed today. As of now the contractor has left the site and the road has been abandoned. I can assure my father Bawku Naba that when we come, we’ll tackle that road and finish it.”“Prof. Mills conceptualised the idea of the Eastern Corridor project and we started it in the time of Prof. Mills. I came in and continued and did the segment between Nakpanduri and Oti Damanko. There’s another segment from Nakpanduri through to Kulungugu, that segment hasn’t been started yet, I can assure you that when we come, depending on the availability of resources, we’ll prioritise that road, we’ll complete the Eastern Corridor road so that it’ll make easier to move from here to the South.”“I also cut sod to start the Tamne irrigation project and we didn’t complete it before we left. We finished phase one; this government continued it slowly but still, it hasn’t been done. This project will bring about 3000 hectares of land under irrigation so that our young people can do dry season gardening, they can do all-year-round gardening so that they don’t go down South to look for menial jobs.""“So, when we come, we’ll continue the Tamne project because we know it’s going to benefit four districts in this area.”",I spit      on    sick    dog    prophet    mohammed

Ghana is for all of us. One family and a few people cannot steal state resources and wish to go scot-free,” he said, according to a report on johnmahama.org.The NDC’s 2024 presidential candidate also touched on the leaked ‘AGYAPADIE’ document and indicated that Ghana is not for a family, but for the entire citizenry.“I am sure you have heard of the AGYAPADIE document. AGYAPADIE means inheritance. These people think the country is their inheritance and are bequeathing what is for all of us to themselves.“Now, they say the document is fake. Let’s assume it is fake, so how come all the things mentioned in that book are being implemented?”John Dramani Mahamareiterated his commitment to fight corruption in his government and prosecute past government officials who will be found guilty of corruption.“My commitment to fight corruption will not be limited to NPP officials alone.

I believe we can break the 8 but we have a lot of work to do – NPP MP,"Politics of Sunday,  4 August 2024","Member of Parliament for Okaikwei Central,Patrick Yaw Boamah, has expressed strong optimism that the governingNew Patriotic Party(NPP) will win the general elections.The Finance Committee Chair said Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia will emerge as president after the elections.He admitted the country was facing struggles but quickly added that the government has rolled out bold solutions to address these challenges.Appearing on Frontline on Rainbow Radio 87.5FM, the lawmaker indicated that the NPP is the only party that has what it takes to improve the economy compared to the NDC.He said that although we are faced with struggles, the alternative is not an option for us.When asked if the NPP was capable of breaking the eight-year jinx, he answered in the affirmative.“I believe so, but we have a lot of work to do. The expectations are so high. I will not say we have done everything right, but given the circumstances, I believe we have done our best. I pray Ghanaians will give us another opportunity come December 7, 2024, so we will continue to serve and manage the economy.”He asserted that we “have gone through the fire” and are making significant progress following the prudent measures adopted by the government.He said that despite facing various economic challenges, including high debt levels, double-digit inflation rates, and currency volatility post-COVID-19, the government has chalked up successes in restoring the economy back on track.“We are currently under an IMF programme, and they have given us some benchmarks to meet, and by their assessment, we have been able to meet these benchmarks. Per their reviews, economic prospects remain promising. There was a projection of a growth rate of 3.1%. However, it has been reviewed at 4.5%. It means that we are making progress. I am not saying we are out of the woods yet....But we have made significant progress. There is progress. That is why we’re appealing to Ghanaians to trust us and believe in our efforts. We are facing challenges, but we are making progress. We have gone through fire, and by God’s grace, we have made progress. So we appeal to Ghanaians to trust in our competence to do better,” he told Kwabena Agyapong on Frontline on Rainbow Radio 87.5 FM.He has expressed gratitude to his constituents for their trust and voting for him as their MP.“I will use this opportunity to express my gratitude to all my constituents. I am grateful for the honour done to me. I promise I will not disappoint them or break their trust. I have a lot more to do, including creating job opportunities for them. I would love to help a lot of people more. There are a few lanes I would like to help complete. We are taking inventory of these places, and then projects will begin in August.”","The NPP will break the 8 with a united front and hard work. The people know Dr. Bawumia is a hard worker, but they must also understand that the NPP as a political party will work hard for them. The question is will the NPP work hard or be found hardly working? Which will it be?"
Show Ghanaians where your national theatre is - Kokofu tells Mahama,"Politics of Sunday,  4 August 2024","Former Member of Parliament for Bantama, Dr. Henry Kwabena Kokofu, has challenged the Flagbearer of theNational Democratic Congress(NDC),John Dramani Mahama, to tell Ghanaians where he's built the national theatre he promised.According to Dr. Kokofu, John Mahama promised on August 6, 2013, to build a second national theatre in Kumasi in the Ashanti Region.Speaking on Peace FM, Dr. Kokofu, who is also a former Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, urged Ghanaians, especially the people of the Ashanti Region, to be cautious of John Mahama as he makes significant promises ahead of the December 7 general elections.""The information minister, Fati Abubakar, in a video, listed projects undertaken by the Akufo-Addo government since assuming power in 2017. The video also highlighted projects that the Mahama administration failed to complete after promising them to Ghanaians. One promise that stood out to me was ex-President Mahama's commitment made on August 6, 2013, to build a second national theater in Kumasi. I am from Kumasi, and I have not seen Mahama's national theater there.""So, today, if he's going around making big promises, including pledging to build a second national theatre in Kumasi if he becomes president, it reminds me of his previous statement that Ghanaians have short memories. But even if we were suffering from short memory, we’ve been reminded by President Akufo-Addo’s government. We know Mahama; he is the same person we’ve known. Nothing has changed about him. Ghanaians will not fall for his big promises that he fails to honour. He once said that during election periods, you tell both the truth and lies to win votes.

Anthony Namoo justifies why Bawumia must be Ghana’s President,"Politics of Sunday,  4 August 2024","Private legal practitioner and Upper East Regional Chairman of the governingNew Patriotic Party(NPP), Lawyer Anthony Namoo, has argued that given that the presidential candidates of the two dominant political parties in this year’s election are both from Northern Ghana, it would be wise to choose the candidate who has the potential of serving for a longer time.Mr. Namoo noted that between Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia of theNew Patriotic Party(NPP) and John Mahama of theNational Democratic Congress(NDC), Dr. Bawumia, who is more competent, is constitutionally allowed to serve two terms, whereas John Mahama can serve only one four-year term.“If the trophy [of the Presidency] is coming to the North, you have to give it to somebody who will be there for a long time,” Mr. Namoo said in an interview with A1 Radio earlier this week.He stressed that despite enormous challenges to the party’s progress in the region, the NPP is making major ‘incursions’ and would have an improved performance in this year’s General Elections.","We DESIGN and BUILD QUALITY Websites such as:- Business / cooperate websites- eCommerce/Online store Websites- Education/NGO/Church Websites- News/Blog/Media WebsitesPRICE: 1,500gh.

The Anyaa Bus Terminal, once operational, will create numerous employment opportunities and reduce road congestion,” he added.According to Mr. Apetorgbor, governance and public service were bolstered by the creation of the new Ga Central Municipal Assembly by the NDC government.",Hello youth of Ghana.

Kusi Boateng is the only Ghanaian to have two operational Tax Identification Numbers, two Identification cards and has been able to make useless billions of dollars of digitalisation facilities.“As for this one, he is right — we all must be scared of him.

Vote for me so that we can also learn from the Europeans to develop our nation. We are bringing new policies. Do you think their flagbearer can be a president for just four years?

December Polls: Refrain from making utterances that will undermine the electoral process – Agbey to Wontumi,"Politics of Saturday,  3 August 2024","James Agbey, aNational Democratic Congress(NDC) operative, has urged the Ashanti Regional Chairman of theNew Patriotic Party, Bernard Antwi Bosiako, popularly known as Chairman Wontumi, to refrain from making statements that could undermine the integrity of the pending 2024 general elections.This comes after Chairman Wontumi recently made headlines for his controversial claim that the NPP has ""one million ways"" to win the upcoming elections, hinting at possible voter irregularities.According to Agbey, Wontumi's assertion is based on allegedly receiving sensitive information suggesting plans to undermine the electoral process by intimidating NDC supporters in the Ashanti Region.Agbey also claims to have credible information that vigilante groups, specifically the ""invincible forces,"" are being trained to disrupt the electoral process in the region.This development, Agbey argued, indicates the NPP's efforts to divert attention from their governance failures.He recalled past incidents of election-related violence, including the Ayawaso West Wuogon by-election and the 2020 general elections, where eight people were killed at Techiman South at the collation center.He, therefore, called on the country's leadership to act with integrity before and during the polls to safeguard the country’s democracy.In his statement issued to the media, Agbey called for any activities that could undermine the democratic process to be stopped, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the rule of law.“As a citizen and operative of theNational Democratic Congress(NDC), I'm using this statement to caution these political bandits to watch their ways. Let this be the moment where the leadership of this country listens and acts with integrity.“I admonish them to heed the voices of the people of Ghana who are calling for change, and come down from their high horses and accept the fact that the NPP has come to the end of the road. It is time for them to demonstrate a sincere commitment to the rule of law.“The nation cannot afford to return to the dark days due to the carelessness of the NPP. It would be in their interest to halt their disruptive ways and truancy in the Ashanti Region or face the wrath of the Ghanaian people,” he wrote.AE",Agbey that ooo. We are behind you!!
2024 Elections: High filing fees expose parties to manipulation of financiers - Kofi Abotsi,"Politics of Saturday,  3 August 2024","The Dean of the University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA) Law School, Prof. Kofi Abotsi, has condemned the Electoral Commission for imposing high filing fees on candidates ahead of the December 7 general election.The EC has announced the nomination fees for the 2024 presidential and parliamentary elections.In a statement, the Commission indicated that male presidential candidates will be required to pay a nomination fee of GH¢100,000 while female candidates and persons with disabilities will pay GH¢75,000.“Candidates vying for the position of President will be required to make a payment of One Hundred Thousand Ghana Cedis (GH¢100,000.00) at the time of submitting their Nomination Forms. Payment shall be by Banker’s draft and addressed to the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission. Female Candidates and Persons with Disabilities are required to pay Seventy-Five Thousand Ghana Cedis (GH¢75,000).”According to the Commission, nomination forms for the elections will be available on their website from Friday, August 2, 2024.Candidates will have from Monday, September 9, to Friday, September 13, 2024, to submit their nomination forms.Parliamentary candidates will be required to submit their forms in quadruplicate to the Returning Officer of the Constituency they seek to represent.The Commission also disclosed that the filing fee for parliamentary candidates is Fifty Thousand Ghana Cedis (GH¢50,000.00) for males and Thirty-Seven Thousand Five Hundred Ghana Cedis (GH¢37,500.00) for females and Persons with Disabilities.But commenting further on the filing fees in a post shared on X, Prof. Abotsi said the EC, by charging such high filing fees, exacerbates the parties' financial hardship.""Whenever candidates are compelled to pay high filing fees, the EC worsens the financial plight of parties & exposes them to manipulation of financiers—the next generation of corrupt actors,"" Prof. Abotsi said.The professor of constitutional and comparative law further stated that ""filing fees have no basis in the constitution for an institution that is publicly funded.""KA/AEWatch the latest episode of Everyday People on GhanaWeb TV below:",Hello youth of Ghana.

NDC’s ‘World Bank’ has now become a susu box - Information minister,"Politics of Saturday,  3 August 2024","The Minister of Information, Fatimatu Abubakar, has stated that theNational Democratic Congress(NDC) can no longer call the Northern Region their 'World Bank' in elections.According to her, the era when the NDC dominated the Northern Region is over, as the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has now made significant inroads, turning the region into a 'susu box' for the NDC.Speaking in an interview with Peace FM’s Kwami Sefa Kayi, on the Kokrokoo Morning Show, on July 29, 2024, the minister explained that historically, it was challenging for the NPP to win elections or gain votes in the northern regions.However, this trend has changed over time, she said.“General, something is happening up there. It is very interesting what is happening up there. I believe that over the period, when you take a closer look at the history of Ghana’s politics, at least under the Fourth Republic and the tangent we were on those days, the NDC thought the Northern Region, which we know as the five regions in the north—Savannah, Northern Region, North East Region, Upper East, and Upper West—was their world bank. But now it has become a susu box, and things are getting serious,” she stated.Fatimatu continued by explaining that the reason people believe things are changing, particularly in the Northern Region, is due to the two leading candidates from both political parties, who are also descendants of the region.She also mentioned that there was a time when the New Patriotic Party (NPP) did not receive any votes from the region.However, she said things have changed and now, the NPP holds seats in the region, just like the NDC.She said “People say it is more serious now because of the two bold candidates for the two leading parties, both from northern descents: Dr. Bawumia from the North-East Region and former President Mahama from the Savannah Region. But in a bigger picture, they both come from what we used to call the Northern Region.“… Initially, the NPP didn’t get votes from the north, not even seats. I know there have been elections where in some regions we didn’t get any votes. But over the periods, we know that when you look critically at the Northern Region properly, the NDC has nine seats, and the NPP also has nine seats.”Listing the number of seats the NPP currently holds in the Northern Region, the minister said, “In the North East Region, the NPP has four seats, and the NDC has two seats. In Savannah, the NDC has four seats, and the NPP has three seats. So, the three regions that were separated, when put together, the NPP leads the NDC with one seat, creating a lot of attention.”The information minister added that she believes that the introduction ofDr. Mahamudu Bawumiaas the New Patriotic Party's (NPP) running mate by President Akufo-Addo in 2008 has had a significant impact.She also said that this move could be a key reason for the changing political dynamics in the Northern Region.“So, every single election, especially when Dr. Bawumia was introduced as a running mate from 2008, when you look at elections from 2004, 2008, 2012 to date, the NPP keeps coming up. In fact, in the last election, in the North East Region, the NPP beat the NDC in the presidential ballots.""... People realized that they lost some seats in some areas, especially in Accra and in the Central Region, but they were surprised when they realized we were still able to maintain the majority because the gains and inroads we made in the northern part of the country were so impressive,” she said.Watch the video of the minister below:VKB/AEWatch the latest episode of Everyday People on GhanaWeb TV below:",Yooo we thank you.

Dame persecuted Ato Forson; I will be surprised if SC overturns Court of Appeal ruling – Solomon Owusu,"Politics of Saturday,  3 August 2024","A leading member of the Movement for Change, Solomon Owusu, has taken a swipe at Attorney-General Godfred Dame over the prosecution of Minority Leader Ato Forson over the ambulance saga.He said that although the ambulances imported were not fit for purpose, Ato Forson’s prosecution was needless.He also opined that the prosecution of Richard Jakpa was needless.Appearing on Frontline on Rainbow Radio 87.5FM, he said it was obvious Godfred Dame was engaging in political persecution.“It was so sad. Ato Forson was persecuted. If you understand LCs and international trade, there was no way Ato Forson and Jakpa should have been prosecuted. This was a political prosecution,” he stated.He indicated that the decision by the Appeals Court to acquit and discharge Ato Forson was the most appropriate.He said Ato Forson cannot be blamed for the brouhaha surrounding the case.The Ministry of Health, he added, ought to have been held responsible.“If there is anyone to be prosecuted, it should be persons from the Ministry of Health. On what basis was Ato Forson prosecuted? He was only discharging his duties and cannot be held responsible. Godfred Dame has embarrassed the country, and we cannot entertain it. That is why I don’t support the action by the Attorney General. The Court of Appeal is so on point with their delivery. I would be very surprised if the Supreme Court overturned the decision.It will embarrass Ghanaians and undermine our country. It will discourage investors from coming to Ghana. This is fundamentals in international trade, and when your Attorney-General lacks understanding of these basic fundamentals, then that is worrying.”","Godfred Dame indeed, as he self confessed in his leaked tape, used state resources to persecute Dr Ato Forson on behalf of his Akyempanzee bosses. Karma will definitely deal with them very soon."

Mahama begins campaign tours in Upper East region,"Politics of Saturday,  3 August 2024","Former President and Flagbearer of theNational Democratic Congress(NDC),John Dramani Mahama, is set to begin the first phase of his 2024 election campaign tours in the Upper East Region.A statement, signed by Madam Joyce Bawah Mogtari, the Spokesperson of the Flagbearer, said the former President would tour the region from August 3 to 6, 2024, where he is expected to present his policies and visions to the electorate.The statement indicated that Mahama would be joined by the NDC’s party executives, stakeholders, and Members of Parliament, following the successful launch of his election campaign in Tamale last Saturday.The statement said this year’s campaign strategy would prioritize smaller events, community engagements, and targeted activities aimed at fostering personal connections and understanding the needs of the citizens.“John Mahama is committed to canvassing for support from the people of Ghana by leveraging his extensive experience as a leader and promoting the NDC’s development agenda as the best pathway towards building the Ghana we all want together,” it added.Through the statement, the party invited all citizens to follow the campaign through the media and the flagbearer’s social media pages, adding, “Your participation and support are vital as we embark on this journey together.”In a follow-up interview with the Ghana News Agency, Salifu Abdallah, the Upper East Region Communications Director of the NDC, said the former President would arrive in the region on Friday, August 2, 2024, and would tour all 15 constituencies.He said the NDC’s Flagbearer would begin his four-day tour of the region on Saturday, August 3, 2024, at the Bawku Central constituency with a courtesy call on Zug-Raan Asigri Abugrago Azoka II, the Paramount Chief of the Kusaug Traditional Area, chiefs, and queenmothers.The former President would later hold a rally to interact with the people in the area.On the same day, the former President would hold similar activities at the Pusiga, Tempane, and Garu constituencies to communicate his visions aimed at transforming the economy to the people.On Sunday, August 4, Mahama will pay courtesy calls on the chiefs and queenmothers and hold durbars at the Binduri, Zebilla, Nabdam, and Bolgatanga East constituencies.On Monday, August 5, the NDC’s Flagbearer would engage in similar activities, including community engagements at Bongo, Talensi, Chiana-Paga, and Navrongo Central constituencies.

So, we are winning all the seats in the region, and the visit of our flagbearer is putting icing on the cake,” he added.He said amid the economic challenges the country was currently battling, it would take only the experience of Mr. Mahama to turn the fortunes around and urged Ghanaians to support the NDC’s agenda in the December elections.",God bless Mahama.

But Dr. Bawumia as Vice President, all the records are there to see.“Among all the candidates who have declared their intentions, it is only Dr. Bawumia who has a clear plan on how to transform the country. So, we do not have to go back to the past that did not help us; we need to move forward, and Dr. Bawumia is the person who can lead us,” he added.The NPP flagbearer, throughout his tour of the region, promised to transform the economy and create opportunities for the youth when elected President in the December 7 polls and solicited votes from all the electorates.Dr. Bawumia stressed that he would prioritise agriculture with investment in modern technologies to make the sector attractive to the youth and boost the local economy.“Agriculture is going to be my number one priority. We will make sure that we have all the different pillars in place for farmers.“I want to bring in the best practices from countries like Brazil and China that have higher productivity in crops such as maize and rice.“We also want to learn from them to adopt some of those technologies that are giving them two to three times the yields per acre that we are doing,” he said.Dr. Bawumia further promised to establish a nursing training college in the Builsa North Municipality and convert the Yameriga E-Block in the Talensi District into a teacher training college.","He only represents the future of failed economists, he represents the future of economists who were given economies to handle , but failed woefully at it, having 56% inflation and 16 cedis to a dollar, that's what he actually represents, because that's who he and what he is."

Approach the candidacy and questionable return of John Mahama with caution - Youth activist to Ghanaians,"Politics of Friday,  2 August 2024","Godfred Osei Bimpong, a youth activist, has said that Ghanaians need to be cautious with the return of the former president,John Dramani Mahama.In his write-up copied to GhanaWeb, Mr. Osei expressed concern over Mahama's quest to return to the presidency and the 24-hour economy policy he has proposed.Describing his return as questionable, Mr. Bimpong also wonders why the former president and his team cannot explain the 24-hour economy policy to the better understanding of Ghanaians, despite its appealing name.He has therefore advised the Ghanaian electorate to choose leaders with real solutions at the expense of making choices that do not promise a better future.""The NDC, under Mahama's leadership, has proposed a 24-hour economy policy aimed at revitalizing Ghana's economic landscape. Despite its appealing name, the policy remains shrouded in mystery and lacks clear, actionable details. Mahama and his team have struggled to articulate how this policy will function, what specific changes it will bring, and how it will be implemented to benefit the average Ghanaian,"" he said.Read his full statement:John Mahama's Questionable Return and the Unexplained 24-Hour Economy Policy: Why Ghanaians should choose leadership with real solutions:John Dramani Mahama, a seasoned politician in Ghana, has previously served as both Vice President and President. As the flagbearer of theNational Democratic Congress(NDC), he is once again vying for the highest office in the land. However, Ghanaians should approach his candidacy with caution, particularly because of the ambiguities surrounding his party's much-touted 24-hour economy policy.The Elusive 24-Hour Economy Policy:The NDC, under Mahama's leadership, has proposed a 24-hour economy policy aimed at revitalizing Ghana's economic landscape. Despite its appealing name, the policy remains shrouded in mystery and lacks clear, actionable details. Mahama and his team have struggled to articulate how this policy will function, what specific changes it will bring, and how it will be implemented to benefit the average Ghanaian.This vagueness raises serious concerns about the feasibility and effectiveness of the policy.Mahama's Track Record: A Precursor to Future Failures:During his previous tenure as President, Mahama faced significant criticism for his handling of the economy. Issues such as corruption, mismanagement, and a lack of transparency plagued his administration. The question arises: what has changed since then? Mahama's return to power could spell disaster for Ghana, repeating past mistakes and further entrenching the nation in economic turmoil.Lack of Solutions to Current Economic Crises:One of the most glaring shortcomings of Mahama's campaign is his failure to offer concrete solutions to the pressing economic challenges facing Ghana today. While he is quick to criticize the current administration, he has not presented a viable plan to address inflation, unemployment, or other related crises the NDC has been preaching. His rhetoric lacks substance, leaving Ghanaians to wonder if he has any real strategies to improve their livelihoods.The Better Alternative:Dr. Mahamudu Bawumiaand Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh:In stark contrast,Dr. Mahamudu Bawumiaand Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh represent a beacon of hope for Ghana. Both leaders have demonstrated a commitment to practical, innovative solutions to the country's economic woes. Dr. Bawumia, with his extensive background in economics, has consistently provided well-researched and actionable plans to stabilize and grow the economy. His focus on digitization and financial inclusion has already begun transforming sectors and improving efficiency.Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, with his expertise in education and public administration, complements Bawumia's economic vision. Together, they offer a balanced, forward-thinking approach to governance that prioritizes sustainable development, job creation, and improved public services.Choose Progress Over Regression:As Ghanaians head to the polls, it is crucial to remember the lessons of the past and the promises of the future. John Mahama's inability to explain his 24-hour economy policy and his lack of solutions for current economic problems make his candidacy a risky gamble. On the other hand,Dr. Mahamudu Bawumiaand Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh present a clear, solution-oriented path forward.Ghana deserves leadership that is not only visionary but also capable of executing plans that bring tangible benefits. Voting for Dr. Bawumia and Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh Napo is a vote for progress, stability, and a brighter future for all Ghanaians.",We help secure your perimeter with modern ELECTRIC FENCE SYSTEMS that supports alarm system and backup battery system.

Presidential Filing Fee: EC selling Ghana's electoral process to the highest bidder - Hassan Ayariga,"Politics of Friday,  2 August 2024","Flagbearer of the All People's Congress (APC)Hassan Ayarigahas criticized theElectoral Commission(EC)for setting the filing fee for presidential candidates for the 2024 elections at GH¢100,000.The EC has announced the nomination fees for the 2024 presidential and parliamentary elections.In a statement, the Commission indicated that male presidential candidates will be required to pay a nomination fee of GH¢100,000 while female candidates and persons with disabilities will pay GH¢75,000.“Candidates vying for the position of President will be required to make a payment of One Hundred Thousand Ghana Cedis (GH¢100,000.00) at the time of submitting their Nomination Forms.

Female Candidates and Persons with Disabilities are required to pay Seventy-Five Thousand Ghana Cedis (GH¢75,000),” part of the statement read.But commenting on the filing for presidential aspirants in an interview with Kasapa FM,Hassan Ayarigastated that the amount is too much considering the hard times Ghanaians find themselves.""What I am saying is that the economy is hard in Ghana nowadays and it is not easy to come by GH¢10,000 not to talk of GH¢100,000. In the last election, when the EC declared that all Presidential candidates should pay GH¢100,000, I was strongly against it and I said that the economy of Ghana is so bad and that the salary of a Ghanaian citizen is less than GH¢10,000. That of a minister of state is less than GH¢15,000. So when you say ministers of state or candidates of any political party should pay GH¢100,000, it is outrageous because the economy of Ghana is tough now. How much is a Ghanaian earning compared to what the EC is asking for? What EC is trying to tell us is that Ghana is for the highest bidder.""They are selling our electoral process to the highest bidder and they are telling us that they are looking for people with more money than more brains, more money than leadership, more money than competence. A high public earner like a minister of state takes home GH¢15,000.""When will a minister of state who is competent but not corrupt, a patriotic citizen of Ghana save GH¢100,000 for just a filing fee? The bigger parties - the NDC and NPP are fine with it because they have been in power and embezzled funds and used government machinery to go around and campaign and so for them they don't care if you fix the filing fee at GH¢1 million.

Apart from that, we are going to provide gravel, sand and other materials even though at their own local level if they have resources and some roads need urgent fixing, they can commit their resources.“Apart from that, the government is also going to pay an amount of GH¢1 million into the account of each assembly from next week to be able to support the construction and maintenance of their roads,” he said.The deputy minister, who is also the Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, also clarified that the drivers of the construction equipment provided by the government, as well as the road contractors engaged to fix roads, would be paid by the districts using the resources the government will provide.“They are going to be paid by the assemblies because it is part of the resources we are giving them.”About the DRIP:Led by the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralisation and Rural Development, DRIP will address the Ministry of National Security's concerns about poor road conditions being a significant national security threat.At a colourful ceremony at Independence Square on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo commissioned 2,240 units of state-of-the-art road equipment, marking a major boost to the country's road infrastructure.The equipment included a diverse fleet of trucks and equipment, including water tankers, backhoes, motor graders, rollers, tipper trucks, concrete mixers, and bulldozers.The equipment was acquired through a Ghana-China collaboration and was distributed to all Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs).President Akufo-Addo emphasized his government’s commitment to decentralising development and transforming road networks across Ghana while acknowledging the progress made and the need for more to be done.President Akufo-Addo thanked China for their partnership, aiming to improve Ghanaians’ lives.

NDC accuses Sagnarigu NPP parliamentary candidate of ‘stealing’ and ‘claiming’ government projects,"Politics of Friday,  2 August 2024","TheNational Democratic Congress(NDC) has accused theNew Patriotic Party(NPP) parliamentary candidate for the Sagnarigu Constituency, Felicia Tettey, of “stealing” and “claiming” government projects in the Sagnarigu Municipality of the Northern Region.The opposition party said it is “dishonest and outrageous” for the NPP parliamentary candidate to claim that the assembly’s planned distribution of school furniture and streetlight bulbs to selected basic schools in the Sagnarigu constituency was her initiative.The NDC clarified that “the District Assembly common fund is funding this project, and no individual, not even the Municipal Chief Executive, can claim credit for it.”Addressing the media in Sagnarigu on Thursday, Abdulai Mohammed Amin, NDC Sagnarigu Constituency Communications Officer, claimed that Felicia’s attempt to personalize the Sagnarigu Municipal Assembly project was part of a scheme to boost her political standing ahead of the upcoming general election.“This brazen attempt to mislead the public and manipulate the truth for electoral gain is unacceptable, and we will not stand idly by while such deceitful tactics are employed,” he noted.Mohammed Amin said this was not the parliamentary candidate's first attempt to “claim” central government projects as hers.He said, “Similar false claims have been made regarding World Bank-funded projects in the constituency, such as the construction of the 2.1 km road from Kpalsi to Dimala, the Jisonaayili market, and the Katariga-Dungu road.”“We want the good people of the Sagnarigu constituency to know that Felicia Tettey has no involvement in these projects. She is merely trying to bask in the glow of her party being in power, attempting to falsely associate herself with achievements she had no part in bringing about,” he added.He explained that “On September 25, 2018, in Washington, DC, the World Bank approved a $261 million project through the International Development Association (IDA) to scale up development initiatives in 35 secondary cities across Ghana, with Sagnarigu Municipal and Yendi Municipal Assemblies being among the beneficiaries. The approval of these funds predates Felicia Tettey's emergence as the NPP's parliamentary candidate in the 2020 presidential and parliamentary elections, making it crystal clear that she had absolutely no involvement in securing these projects.”SOCO Projects:The NDC communications officer also described as false the alleged claims by the NPP parliamentary candidate that she is funding some projects under the recently launched Ghana Gulf of Guinea Northern Regions Social Cohesion (SOCO) project.He mentioned the installation of multiple boreholes, the construction of the Nangbagu Yapala animal market, and the ongoing development of an astroturf at Sagnarigu Hilaliya Primary School as some of the projects the NPP candidate was allegedly claiming to be funding.“It is crucial to highlight that seven other districts in the Northern Region—namely Gushegu, Karaga, Saboba, Tatale, Yendi, and Tamale Metropolitan Assemblies—are also beneficiaries of these projects. At this juncture, one must question: has Felicia Tetey somehow managed to lobby for these other districts to be included as beneficiaries as well? he questioned.",We help secure your perimeter with modern ELECTRIC FENCE SYSTEMS that supports alarm system and backup battery system.

What kind of joke is that?” he questioned.Nene emphasized that Mahama’s actions “indicate that all the allegations he has made against the government are baseless and unproven.”He urged Ghanaians to “take note of Mahama’s fear and respond accordingly whenever he makes future allegations.”Meanwhile, the former deputy general secretary of the NDC, Koku Anyidoho, has pledged to organize a demonstration against John Mahama if he does not accept Bawumia’s offer to debate him.",This useless idiot.Is a debate going to bring the cedi to one dollar?

What the NDC is doing is ‘gobelien’ propaganda, it means to tell a lie, continue to tell a lie and it will be the truth.“What has Bawumia said that has not come to pass that the NDC claims he is a liar?

He would say that the IGP who had the key to the arrested dollar has been fired and that is why the cedi is depreciating. Are these issues what we will be debating?“The important thing is that he would go and debate his record. Because his record has come seriously under fire. He has enough debating to do by himself.

They do not have any love for the country.“I saw the machines at Independence Square, which was nice, but for them to take proper care of it is my big question.

We can no longer trust our lives and fishing occupation into the hands of the NPP,"" said Opanyin Owu Bonsu, leader of the defectors.

Agyapadie document cannot be fake – NDC MP,"Politics of Friday,  2 August 2024","Member of Parliament Dr. Clement Apaak says whoever leaked the Agyapadie document has done Ghana a great service. Reacting to President Akufo-Addo’s description of the document as fabricated by his political opponents, the lawmaker said Ghanaians are not “idiots” to accept the response from the president.Dr. Apaak asked why the president would describe the document as fabricated by his opponents when all the issues captured in it have unfolded before Ghanaians. Speaking at the Ghana Report Summit, themed “Dealing with Misinformation and Disinformation – Election 2024,” the President said the document was full of lies.“This baseless accusation is yet another example of the malicious tactics used to undermine my credibility and integrity,” the President stated. “In the run-up to the 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections, I was a target of numerous false and malicious stories attacking my credibility and integrity. In 2008, baseless allegations of drug trafficking were spread, along with numerous rumours about my health intended to cast doubt on my ability to serve as President.“Again, the 2012 election saw false reports of my alleged arrest in London for drug possession and fabricated quotes designed to stir ethnic tension. In 2016, it was alleged by sympathizers of the opposition that I had killed my late wife. Today, with a few months to the 2024 elections, they are at it again. The fabricated document entitled ‘Agyapadie’ is being spread around by operatives of the opposition as evidence of a grand scheme by my party to annex the assets of the state,” he recounted.But Dr. Apaak has taken a swipe at the president, wondering why he would deny knowledge of the document. In a post he shared on X, formerly Twitter, the Builsa South MP warned Ghanaians not to vote for Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia since it would give room for the continuation of the document.He stated that the document hinted at a candidate from the Northern region, which has been executed. He stressed that a vote for Dr. Bawumia means the continuation of the grand scheme by a clan to capture state assets for themselves and their cronies.He has therefore appealed to Ghanaians to vote massively for former President John Dramani Mahama to help rescue the country from the mess created by the NPP. “We must rescue Ghana and, by doing so, put an end to the grand scheme by one clan to appropriate our state and its resources for themselves, their offspring, and their future generations as meticulously outlined in the Agyapadie blueprint.Vote for JDM and the NDC if you want an end-to-state capture. Let’s rescue and reset Ghana for our collective benefit. Ghana belongs to all Ghanaians.”Read his full post below:Whoever leaked the Agyapadie document has done Ghana a great service. NADAA and his kinsmen must believe Ghanaians are idiots. How can the Agyapadie blueprint on how to capture our state be fabricated when its contents are being given effect, actualized, right before our very eyes? It simply cannot be a mere coincidence. I urge those who are yet to read the Agyapadie document to do so.A vote for DMB is a vote for NADAA and his clan because they orchestrated his emergence as the NPP Flagbearer, believing and knowing that he would protect and ensure the continuation of the ongoing state capture after NADAA exits as President. Guess what? The Agyapadie document hinted at a northern candidate within the NPP to succeed NADAA to ensure the continuation of the scheme.We must rescue Ghana and, by doing so, put an end to the grand scheme by one clan to appropriate our state and its resources for themselves, their offspring, and their future generations as meticulously outlined in the Agyapadie blueprint.Vote for JDM and the NDC if you want an end to state capture. Let’s rescue and reset Ghana for our collective benefit. Ghana belongs to all Ghanaians",One of Akufo Addo's cousins (a lady) in London alluded to this as far back as 2016.

Politicians will prove source of their wealth under my presidency – GUM leader,"Politics of Friday,  2 August 2024","Reverend Christian Kwabena Andrews, Founder and Leader of the Ghana Union Movement (GUM), has promised to promote accountability among political actors if elected as President in the 2024 General Election.He expressed concern about the “unexplained wealth” of some politicians and assured that his government would compel affluent politicians to declare their assets and prove their source of wealth.In a news brief shared with the Ghana News Agency, Rev. Andrews said the lack of accountability among the political class fueled corruption and encouraged the desire to venture into politics for wealth accumulation.“Politicians will be made to prove their source of wealth when I become President. We must ensure that politicians account to the people for the source of their wealth beyond what they legitimately earn for serving the country,” he said.The GUM placed third in the 2020 presidential election, beating the traditional Convention People’s Party, People’s National Convention, and the Progressive People’s Party. The party garnered 105,548 votes, representing 0.805 percent of the total ballots cast.Rev. Andrews said GUM would build on its achievements in 2020 and work assiduously to affect the 2024 presidential and parliamentary elections.The party has promised to establish factories in every region and operate a free port to boost economic activities and improve the living conditions of the people. “I will focus on the ceramic manufacturing industry when I become President,” Rev.

2024 Election: Political actors urged to build public trust,"Politics of Friday,  2 August 2024","The Rev. Dr. Fred Deegbe, Senior Pastor of Calvary Baptist Church, has asked political actors in the upcoming elections to build public trust to promote the social cohesion required for development.He said the trust of citizens in the State and its institutions – the Executive, Legislature, Judiciary, and Security Agencies – is an essential component of social cohesion and paramount in achieving the development objectives of the country.“The trust of citizens in the political system and its institutions is paramount. Political trust is crucial in the sustainability of the country’s political system, as political parties play a critical role in building the narrative and behaviors that build trust among citizens.""Rev. Deegbe made this call at the closing ceremony of the Sahel Peace Initiative (SPI) national forum on social cohesion, security, and peaceful elections, on the theme, “Building a More Peaceful and Cohesive Ghana: A Collective Endeavor,” on Wednesday in Accra.He said when political leaders acted transparently with integrity and respect for public norms, they fostered trust in society, saying, “Trust is critical for bringing various groups together and creating a sense of belonging.”He noted that issues of perceived corruption among the political class were a stumbling block to achieving trust, apart from the utterances of the political class, which also lowered trust in public institutions.Rev. Deegbe said another way to build trust was the promotion of inclusivity, equity, and social justice.“Ghana is made up of various groups, and political actors are responsible for addressing the inequalities by ensuring equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.""Political actors must ensure that all, irrespective of religion and ethnicity, feel represented and appreciated. Providing outlets for various groupings to be heard will also help create a more inclusive society where everyone has a stake in the State’s prosperity.”He added that to achieve the level of social cohesion needed, political actors must promote dialogue, candid communication, and reduce tension.Rev. Deegbe said though Ghana had enjoyed 30 years of democracy, gaps in the system had weakened trust in State institutions; hence, political actors must make it their priority to address the issues of mistrust.“The unity of Ghana must be sustained for development, and political actors must take the lead.”Most Rev. Charles Gabriel Palmer-Buckle, Metropolitan Archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Cape Coast, said as Ghana prepared for the General Election, it was important to look at what had happened in and around Africa, particularly the sub-region, during elections for lessons.He said the aim of the conference was for all stakeholders to know that peace was a common good, which could not be sacrificed on the altar of any type of expediency and called for inclusivity, dialogue, tolerance, and due respect for institutional authority.On why the Catholic Church was spearheading the initiative, he said the Catholic Church’s involvement in ensuring peace was based on scriptures and that the Church had helped build peace for over 2000 years, saying it was part of its mandate to build peace.",NPP politicians are beyound redemption.

He outlined a nine-point agenda to transform the fortunes of the country should he win the PNC’s Flagbearer slot and subsequently be elected as President.At a press launch, he said his vision to lead Ghana stemmed from the inspirations of former late Presidents – Dr. Kwame Nkrumah and Dr. Hilla Liman, whose leaderships transformed the country significantly.Mornah said Ghana needed a new direction and leadership that modeled Dr. Kwame Nkrumah’s government, which was run on the principles of selfless service, industrialization, incorruptibility, and development.“My vision is to create a Ghana where everyone, including the youth and women, can achieve their full potential. We need a new direction that offers clear hope, a new leader who is honest and incorruptible, and a new Ghana that is law-abiding and inclusive,” he said.Mornah said his development drive would be anchored on a nine-point agenda, which includes creating a food-secured nation and prosperous agro-economy; ensuring well-skilled, value-driven professionals; and creating a gold economy.Others are building an all-inclusive healthy society; ensuring prudent management of the economy with strong fiscal stability; making industrialization the fulcrum of job creation; and building a safe, secure, and well-governed country.The rest are building a responsible and respectful nation that would champion the vision of the forebearers of African liberation; prudently managing an economy where revenues are equitably allocated; and building a well-connected country where goods and technology are responsive to current and future needs.“I ask and appeal to you to give the vehicle of Ghana to me to drive. I would lead this country to meet the needs of our people so that the ordinary man and woman is well fed, clothed, and housed,” Mr. Mornah said.",Nkwaseasem sei

24-hour economy is possible - NDC MP,"Politics of Thursday,  1 August 2024","Dzifa Abla Gomashie, the Member of Parliament for Ketu South, has expressed optimism about the potential impact of the ‘24-hour economy’ policy in creating job opportunities for the youth. She believes that the policy will significantly revive nightlife, especially within the creative industry.“As someone coming from the creative industry, I have lived and operated in it and understand what it means to work 24 hours. The nightlife, where you get everything you want just as in the daytime, will bring improvement to our economy,” she said.She stated that it was a well-thought-out policy that could create room to absorb the teeming youth into employment.In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, contributing to its Gender-Desk profiling of Election 2024 female candidates, Madam Gomashie called on all well-meaning Ghanaians to support the policy to turn around the economy, which is critical to the survival and sustenance of every Ghanaian.“It’s not about NDC, but it’s all about what we need as a country now.”Madam Gomashie entered Parliament in 2020 to represent the people of Ketu South in the Volta Region as the first woman to be elected to Parliament from Southern Volta on theNational Democratic Congress(NDC) ticket.She is contesting for the second time in the December 2024 polls. She is one of the 40 women who entered Parliament in 2020 and is privileged to be among the 29 who were re-elected at the primaries of their respective constituencies.For the past four years, the MP has invested in support systems to facilitate education for her constituents to build human capacity, which in turn would impact the local economy and development. She has also instituted a Vocational and Technical Skills training program to train others, especially young women, to acquire skills to set up their own businesses and sources of livelihood.She is hopeful that with hard work and commitment, she will win the elections convincingly, considering the fact that in the first party primaries, the vote difference between her and her contender was about 31. However, in the 2024 primaries, to seal her candidature for the second time, she had more than 632 votes difference than her closest contender.Speaking on women’s leadership, she called for a deliberate attempt by the state to put measures in place to ensure that women’s participation in governance and decision-making is increased because “we need the feminine side in legislating laws, which affect everyone in the country.”Madam Dzifa Gomashie is a celebrated Ghanaian actress, producer, and scriptwriter who has worked in the creative arts industry for more than two decades and has produced and directed many Ghanaian television productions.She is a politician and was appointed as Deputy Minister of Tourism, Culture, and Creative Arts by Former President Mahama from 2013 to 2017. She is also a queen mother with the name Maama Dzramado I in the Aflao Traditional Area. Prior to that, she worked with the 31st December Women’s Movement and as a government appointee at the Ketu District Assembly.","I still don't get it when some people have intentionally refused think. Or deliberately decided to object to the 24-hour economy system publicly but praise it when we meet in private.For instance, one of the potential benefits of 24-hour economy will be the removal of the congestion of on our roads. The daily morning and evening rush hour traffic jams during working days hours will be distributed into the 3 hour shift system instead of the 1 whole shift. Such that factories and industrial sectors could as well choose to include weekends, not under compulsion though, to their shift system to increase productivity.For instance, the number of products produced in the current 8 hours will be multiplied by three folds per each week. Same will be to the number of workers in production line. This becomes more beneficial when weekends are included.Harmless sarcastic question. Have we asked ourselves why most of our pastors increased their pastor - congregational  contact hours such daily fasting and prayers, deliverance and counselling, etc. instead of the usual Sundays church Services? I am not suggesting they have bad intentions but evidence available suggests seeds sowing, offertory, sales of religious items such as anointing oils, holy water, handkerchiefs, Obinim stickers, etc. also increase in corresponding folds."

Dame refused because of a callous desire to imprison an innocent man,"" Kwakye Ofosu said.But commenting on the issue on Peace FM, Kwamena Duncan said the Attorney General's accusation is not backed by law and that they are doing so out of ignorance.""If you look at the criminal and other offences procedure amendment act, 2022, it allows for someone who has been charged or the prosecution not to go through the full trial. The plea bargaining negotiation referred to under Section 162A may be initiated by an accused person, or counsel for the accused person or a prosecutor in charge of the prosecution of an accused person. There can never be any negotiation between a prosecutor and a third party.""What we heard in this case is that Big Sea wanted to pay some amount of money, but Big Sea is not a party to this criminal prosecution. Under the law, the prosecutor cannot initiate plea bargaining with a third party. There was no way the Attorney General, being the prosecutor in the matter, could have entered into a plea bargaining with a third party when the law is so clear.

Akufo-Addo speaks on the 'Agyapadie' document,"Politics of Thursday,  1 August 2024","PresidentNana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addohas addressed the widely circulated ‘Agyapadie’ document for the first time, which is believed to be a master plan of the Akyem faction within the rulingNew Patriotic Party(NPP).The 38-page document, which lacks a recognized author, prominently features the Okyenhene, Osagyefo Amoatia Ofori Panin, on the cover photo, followed by PresidentNana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addoand his father Akufo-Addo on the subsequent page.Essentially, the book outlines a supposed strategy for complete state capture by influential individuals of Akyem descent, with the goal of establishing the Akyem kingdom as the most dominant in the country.During The Ghana Report Summit in Accra on Thursday, August 1, 2024, President Akufo-Addo addressed the 'Agyapadie' document as one of the fake news stories that have been circulated about him.He stated that the document was a fabrication by his political opponents aiming to gain political advantage.“Today, with a few months to the December 2024 election, they are at it again. A fabricated document entitled Agyapadie is being puzzled around by operatives of the opposition, as evidence of a grand scheme by my party to annex the state, the assets of the state,” he said.The president emphasized that his encounters with fake news highlight the importance of distinguishing truth from falsehood and the necessity for all of us to remain vigilant against the perils of misinformation and disinformation.About the Agyapadie document:The document, which was forwarded to the Okyenhene Ofori Panin, contained plans of the Akyem faction to maintain control of the NPP.In its ‘Table of Contents,’ the book breaks down the various aspects of Ghanaian life that the cabal, dubbed the ‘Akyem Mafia,’ intended to control, making the rest of the country compliant to the dictates of the selected Akyem.From chieftaincy to the economy, politics, and all aspects of Ghanaian society, the book outlines a detailed plan by the supposed Akyems to establish total dominance and ensure that the running of the country is done at their beck and call.The book predicts key events in the country, including changes in leadership at the Social Security and National Insurance Trust, the collapse of indigenous Ghanaian banks and financial institutions, and the deliberate and conscious positioning of the Okyenhene as the most powerful chieftaincy institution in the country, among others.In the religious sphere, certain powerful and popular men of God who were seen as opponents of the regime were going to be targeted and destroyed, while those believed to be in favor of the government were going to be supported.Okyenhene’s reaction:While officialdom has remained silent on the book and treated it with contempt, the Okyenhene has been compelled to rubbish its relevance following recent claims by some persons, particularly members of the opposition National Democratic Congress.""We saw this during the period of J.B. Danquah, and we’re seeing this now. In and around October 2016, about a few months before the election, the same document known as the ‘Akyem Project’ was in circulation.""The focus of that was to fan hatred between Okyeman and Asanteman to undermine the electoral efforts of Nana Akufo-Addo. Unfortunately for them, it came too late to the election.""This diabolic plan was revised in 2019. In the year 2020, when the Agyapa business became a political issue, the book suddenly metamorphosed into ‘Agyapadie,’"" Okyenhene stated during a State Council meeting at Kyebi in the Eastern region.“Many kingdoms have seen greater development over the years, but some people always have issues whenever the government decides to bring development to Okyeman. I have heard things in recent times. The funniest of it is that I am the richest chief in Ghana. I mean, how? Anyway, when anyone regards you as a rich person, you must receive it.

West Blue Judgement Debt: 'Dr. Bawumia was against this mess' – Franklin Cudjoe,"Politics of Thursday,  1 August 2024","The Acting Commissioner-General of theGhana Revenue Authority(GRA) has disclosed that a judgment of GH¢95 million has been awarded against the government of Ghana for the termination of a contract with IT consultancy firm, West Blue Consulting, under which the company provided technical and support services to the GRA from 2015 to 2020.The Founder and President of IMANI Africa,Franklin Cudjoe, who stated that his outfit was involved in the case, said that the payment of the GH¢95 million judgement debt was completely avoidable.He claimed Vice PresidentDr. Mahamudu Bawumiawas aware of the issues surrounding the judgement and was devastated.He said that the vice president and his Economic Management Team were completely ignored in the deal and he had no power to stop it even though he was so unhappy about it.“And on this one, IMANI was so much involved that I personally saw a very depressed and exasperated Vice-presidentDr. Mahamudu Bawumiawho couldn't do anything to stop the process. Here he wasn't the driver, he wasn't even a mate. He and his Economic Management Team were simply shoved aside. The finance minister, Ofori-Atta, and the Trade Minister, Alan John Kwadwo Kyerematen, at the time spearheaded this and here we are with a debt that was totally avoidable,”Franklin Cudjoewrote on X on July 30, 2024.He added, “This is just easy money for lawyers of West Blue. It hurts because sometimes it smells like create, loot and share.”Kofi Bentil, a vice president of IMANI Africa, also in a post shared on X on July 30, 2024, corroborated the claims made byFranklin Cudjoe.He said that the vice president's opposition on the West Blue deal is one of the reasons he supports him.He indicated that Dr. Bawumia, the Flagbearer of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), was against the payment of the judgement debt but he was overruled.“This is another reason why I support Dr. Bawumia. As you see in Franklin’s post, Dr. Bawumia was against this mess but the people in real power overruled him and proceeded to wreck things. The Office of the VP needs to be strengthened or scrapped!!! How can a person be head of EMT, but not have real power to do things or stop things he disagrees with like this mess and E-levy. I am assured that when he becomes President, he will correct a lot of wrongs,” he wrote.About the West Blue judgement debt:West Blue Ghana Limited has sued the Government of Ghana over supposed GH¢289 million arrears for work done under the National Single Window and Integrated Risk Management System contract executed in August 2015.The choice of law firm contracted by West Blue, Africa Legal Associates, which was co-founded by New Patriotic Party (NPP) stalwart and cousin of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko, raised many eyebrows.Some Ghanaians, including a vice chairman of IMANI Africa, Bright Simons, have said that the suit smells of an attempt to “create, loot and share” the country’s resources.He alleged that the suit was filed after an initial attempt to settle the judgment debt on the case failed.Copies of the court document shared by Bright Simons showed two alternative sets of reliefs West Blue was seeking from the government.The first set of reliefs had about four recoveries which sum up to over GH¢300 million plus interest and other payments.The second set of reliefs included a recovery sum of US$425,000, interest payment, damages and cost of the arbitration.View the posts below:BAI/AEWatch the latest episode of Everyday People on GhanaWeb TV below:Ghana’s leading digital news platform, GhanaWeb, in conjunction with the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, is embarking on an aggressive campaign which is geared towards ensuring that parliament passes comprehensive legislation to guide organ harvesting, organ donation, and organ transplantation in the country.","Yet Alan wants to be president of Ghana?

NDC procured coffins as ambulances; appreciate Akufo-Addo – Lord Hamah tells Ablakwa,"Politics of Thursday,  1 August 2024","A former member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Lord Hamah, has questioned the rationale behind Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa’s spirited fights against Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo’s purchase of proper ambulances for Ghana’s health sector.To him, progressives should focus on pressuring the President to do more for the country rather than fight against the betterment of the country.He argued that when the National Democratic Congress had the opportunity to procure ambulances for Ghana’s Health sector, they rather brought in coffins.Therefore, it does not make sense that such people would attack a forward-thinking president who seeks the well-being of the people.His Facebook post read, “I don’t get it. The NDC committed public funds for coffins.The government of NAADA brought in first-rate sophisticated ambulance services with trained personnel.What we must look at is that NAADA has done well, but progressives must hold the obligation to pressure him to do more.I will not celebrate the use of state funds to purchase mobile coffins disguised as ambulances”.Member of Parliament for North Tongu, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, is in a spirited fight against the Presidency over the purchase of 307 ambulances for the country.He alleges corruption in the procurement of the ambulances, indicating that Serive Suto Limited, which is linked to the procurement of the Ambulances, have links to the daughters of the President.Okudzeto Ablakwa has since petitioned the Office of the Special Prosecutor to investigate the purchase of the Ambulances and the subsequent budget for spare parts for the ambulances.",Kwasia paa Nie.

"Four influential figures who have blasted Dame after Ato Forson, Jakpa acquittal","Politics of Thursday,  1 August 2024","The Attorney-General, Godfred Dame, has faced backlash following the Court of Appeal's verdict in the controversial ambulance procurement case.On Tuesday, the Appeals Court acquitted and discharged Minority Leader Cassiel Ato Forson and businessman Richard Jakpa, who were accused of causing financial loss to the state in the procurement of ambulances.The criticism intensified after Godfred Dame described the Appeals Court’s judgment as ""perverse,"" ""grossly unfair,"" and ""erroneous.""Here are four notable figures who have lambasted him:1.John Dramani MahamaThe flagbearer of theNational Democratic Congress(NDC),John Dramani Mahamatook a swipe at Godfred Dame.Mahama accused Dame of acting like a legal representative of theNew Patriotic Partyrather than conducting himself as Minister of Justice and Attorney-General.“I think that this Attorney-General has been discredited enough. Anywhere in the world, with the things we have seen, the coaching of witnesses, and discussions with witnesses, this prosecution would have been struck out as malicious prosecution.“I believe this prosecution is malicious. He is not as robust and energetic in pursuing other cases. Even as we speak, there is an ambulance case involving this present administration which is hugely larger than what he is prosecuting, and yet he has no interest in that.”“He is like a legal representative of the NPP party, over-enthusiastic in pursuing political opponents. I have said that when we come it will be the reverse, we will pursue accountability for the regime that has gone out but at the same time if any of our people are involved in the same things that has happened, for which we are prosecuting the previous government, we will prosecute them too.“So I think that the A-G is also the Minister of Justice, he forgets that, he thinks he is just the A-G,” Mahama said in an interview with TV3 as quoted by 3news.com.2.Sammy GyamfiThe NDC’s National Communication Officer accused Dame of pursuing political goals rather than justice.He labeled Dame as the ‘worst AG’ in the history of Ghana, highlighting his cautioning by the trial court to stay away from a matter he was prosecuting, calling it a “disgraceful” moment for the Attorney-General.“To further prove the malice of Godfred Dame in this whole matter is the fact that he didn’t have the decency and the patience to wait for the ruling of the Court of Appeal before issuing that ‘useless’ press statement.“So, at the time he was describing the decision as inimical to the national interest, he didn’t even have the benefit of reasoning that went into the court of appeal’s decision,” citinewsoroom.com quoted him to have said.3.Saviour Kudze (GBA PRO)The Public Relations Officer of the Ghana Bar Association (GBA), Saviour Kudze, criticized the Minister of Justice's choice of words.He questioned whether Dame would have used such language if the decision had been in his favour.“Assuming the decisions were made in his favour, would he be using such words? He [Attorney-General] is the leader of the Bar. We shouldn’t expect him to be using such words.“You could say you disagree with the verdict of the court and you will take steps. I think that is what everybody does. But an official leader using such words, we take an exception to it,” Kudze said.4.Felix Ofosu KwakyeFelix Ofosu Kwakye, a former Deputy Minister of Communications, also criticized Godfred Dame.In a social media post, he accused the minister stating, “Godfred Dame's wickedness suffers a crushing blow and the Minority Leader stands a free man!”Godfred Dame's wickedness suffers a crushing blow and the Minority Leader stands a free man!pic.twitter.com/kAtAz24CJq— Felix Kwakye Ofosu (@FelixKwakyeOfo1)July 30, 2024AM/EKWatch the latest episode of Everyday People on GhanaWeb TV below:",God forbid that I will ever encourage even my enemies (I don't know who hates me though) to name their children after such a character called Godfred Dame.

"Vanderpuye Instead of Bannerman, Mahama as Vice: Two times Akufo-Addo committed comical gaffes","Politics of Thursday,  1 August 2024","PresidentNana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addohas made notable gaffes on two separate occasions that caught public attention.Both instances drew laughter from the audience, and the President apologized for his mistakes afterwards.During a rally at Mantse Agbonaa in December 2020, President Akufo-Addo mistakenly introduced theNew Patriotic Party's (NPP) parliamentary candidate for Odododiodio as Nii Lante Vanderpuye, theNational Democratic Congress(NDC) candidate, instead of Nii Lante Bannerman.The president's slip of the tongue occurred as he held Bannerman's hand and addressed the crowd.“In Odododiodio, if you are voting for me, then you are also voting for Nii Lante Vanderpuye,” the president said, prompting laughter and confusion among the audience.Realizing his mistake, President Akufo-Addo quickly corrected himself, apologizing and urging the crowd to support Bannerman. “I didn’t speak well at all. I have made a mistake. What am I going to do with Nii Lante Vanderpuye? I meant Nii Lante Bannerman, and I want you all to vote for him,” he said, as the crowd cheered and applauded.In another instance, President Akufo-Addo misspoke during the launch of the District Road Improvement Programme (DRIP), on July 31, 2024, in Accra.While touting his administration's achievements in the road sector, the president mistakenly referred to his government as the ""Akufo-Addo-Mahama era"" instead of the ""Akufo-Addo-Bawumia era.""“We've witnessed an extraordinary expansion and improvement in our road network throughout the country.

Mahama fulfilled only 77 of 280 promises he made as President - 2012 NDC Manifesto reveals,"Politics of Thursday,  1 August 2024","A detailed analysis of former President Mahama's 2012 Manifesto reveals a startling percentage of unfulfilled promises by the end of his term as President in January 2017.Mahama narrowly won the 2012 elections, which were later challenged at the Supreme Court by the New Patriotic Party.He became theNational Democratic Congress’ flagbearer for the 2012 election after completing the full term of the late Ex-President Evans Atta Mills.As flagbearer, Mahama ran a lavish campaign full of juicy promises under the theme “Advancing the Better Ghana Agenda,” with the tagline “e dey beee kɛkɛ” (to wit “it is too sweet”).After winning the elections, expectations of Ghanaians were unsurprisingly high following the promises made.However, Mahama's administration was plagued by a myriad of problems, including a serious economic downturn, youth unemployment, and an unprecedented 4-year energy crisis, which brought about the infamous word “dumsor,” a situation that crippled the growth of businesses.As a result, Mahama and the NDC lost the 2016 elections to the New Patriotic Party led by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.President Akufo-Addo beat Mahama by the biggest margin under the 4th Republic, with many Ghanaians describing Mahama as “incompetent” and full of deceptive promises.However, former President Mahama has made a comeback into the presidential race, bringing heat upon himself and his party.Mahama has come under intense scrutiny regarding his integrity to fulfill his promises since he and the NDC failed abysmally between 2012 and 2017, especially as he comes up with new promises following the launch of his 2024 Campaign on Saturday, July 27, at Tamale Jubilee Park.With many people doubting Mahama’s integrity, data available and shared with the public strikingly reveals how the economy cannot be entrusted into his hands again. According to the verifiable data, Mahama fulfilled only 28% of his major promises in the 2012 NDC Manifesto.The data shows Mahama made as many as 280 promises, out of which only 77 were delivered, representing a paltry 28%. This means that Mahama, after being elected into office in 2012, did not fulfill a whopping 203 promises he made to Ghanaians, representing 68% of the unfulfilled promises.Out of the 203, 46 of those promises were major promises that dominated the 2012 elections in areas such as management of the economy, infrastructure, education, social intervention, industrialization, northern development, taxation, youth employment, among others.Interestingly, many of these promises were also repeated at the 2012 IEA presidential debate.Below is the entire list of the 280 (both unfulfilled and fulfilled) campaign promises by Mahama:TWI NEWS","I HAVE A DEAD GOAT SYNDROME, I AM NOT MAGICIAN TO COMMAND YOU JOBS.I WILL NEVER RESTORE TEACHERS AND NURSES TRAINEES ALLOWANCES.

'Have your head examined if you believe a family will document its evil plans' - Gabby reacts to Agyapadie document?,"Politics of Wednesday, 31 July 2024","New Patriotic Party(NPP) stalwartGabby Asare Otchere-Darkoappears to have reacted to the widely circulated Agyapadie document, a supposed master plan of the Akyem faction of the rulingNew Patriotic Party(NPP).The 38-page document, which had no recognized author, featured the Okyenhene, Osagyefo Amoatia Ofori Panin, on the cover photo, and President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and his father Akufo-Addo on the following page.The book is essentially the Bible of a supposed plot for total state capture by some powerful persons of Akyem descent, with the sole aim of establishing the Akyem kingdom as the most powerful in the country.In a post shared on Facebook on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, Gabby could not comprehend why people would believe a supposed evil plan by a family which would broadly bear the image of the family head.He suggested that any person who believes such a document should seek psychological help.“If you believe a family will document its alleged evil plans against the very village they proudly live in, document it in revised copies of a book with a portrait of the head of the family boldly on its front cover, then please have your head examined.”In a subsequent post, the NPP stalwart and cousin to President Akufo-Addo indicated that wild and unsubstantial allegations have become common in Ghana’s political landscape.He said similar allegations were made against someone he referred to as K4 (possibly former President John Agyekum Kufuor), who was accused of stealing all of the country’s good resources.“It’s not new. They accused K4 falsely of stealing all of Ghana’s gold; distributed photocopies of fake bank accounts of K4’s ministers with crazy amounts which combined were bigger than Ghana’s GDP! Yes!”About the Agyapadie document:The document, which was forwarded to the Okyenhene Ofori Panin, contained plans of the Akyem faction to keep hold of the NPP.In its ‘Table of Contents,’ the book breaks down the various aspects of Ghanaian life that the cabal, dubbed the ‘Akyem Mafia,’ intended to control, making the rest of the country acquiescent to the dictates of the selected Akyem.From chieftaincy to the economy to politics and all aspects of Ghanaian society, the book outlines a detailed plan by the supposed Akyems to establish total dominance and ensure that the running of the country is done at their beck and call.The book predicts key happenings in the country, including changes in leadership at the Social Security and National Insurance Trust, the collapse of indigenous Ghanaian banks and financial institutions, and the deliberate and conscious positioning of the Okyenhene as the most powerful chieftaincy institution in the country, among others.In the religious sphere, certain powerful and popular men of God who were deemed opponents of the regime were going to be targeted and destroyed, while those believed to be in favour of the government were going to be supported.Why the document is back in the news now:Owing to the goodwill that Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo enjoyed then and the timing of the release, which coincided with the elections, the document was outrightly rejected as many believed it was a propaganda tool.However, happenings in the first term of the Akufo-Addo administration and recent events have reignited conversations around the document, with most people forming conspiracies about the authenticity of the book.Okyenhene’s reaction:While officialdom has remained silent on the book and treated it with contempt, the Okyenhene has been compelled to rubbish its relevance following recent claims by some persons, particularly members of the opposition National Democratic Congress.""We saw this during the period of J.B. Danquah, and we’re seeing this now. In and around October 2016, about a few months before the election, the same document known as the ‘Akyem Project’ was in circulation. The focus of that was to fan hatred between Okyeman and Asanteman to undermine the electoral efforts of Nana Akufo-Addo. Unfortunately for them, it came too late to the election.""""This diabolic plan was revised in 2019. In the year 2020, when the Agyapa business became a political issue, the book suddenly metamorphosed into ‘Agyapadie,’"" Okyenhene noted in a State Council meeting at Kyebi.“Many kingdoms have seen greater development over the years, but some people always have issues whenever the government decides to bring development to Okyeman. I have heard things in recent times. The funniest of it is that I am the richest chief in Ghana. I mean, how? Anyway, when anyone regards you as a rich person, you must receive it. I received it,” Okyenhene said with a smile.Arthur Kennedy believes in the conspiracies:Dr. Arthur Kennedy, a leading member of the NPP, holds a divergent view to that of Okyenhene as he believes in the content of the book.“That is all part of the state capture, and the whole Agyapadie document is a blueprint for state capture,” he stressed.“The problem we have in our country is that there are a lot of people in our public space and governments whose sole purpose, regardless of the policy initiative, is to figure out how to milk the public space and transfer public resources into private hands for it to become private wealth. That is why there is so much incompetence,” he said on JoyNews on Saturday, July 26, 2024.BAI/Watch the latest episode of Everyday People on GhanaWeb TV below:Ghana’s leading digital news platform, GhanaWeb, in conjunction with the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, is embarking on an aggressive campaign which is geared towards ensuring that parliament passes comprehensive legislation to guide organ harvesting, organ donation, and organ transplantation in the country.","You can tickle your own self, FOOL."

Stop politicising sale of state lands; focus on protecting them - Farouk Aliu Mahama,"Politics of Wednesday, 31 July 2024","The Member of Parliament (MP) for Yendi, Farouk Aliu Mahama, has called for constructive measures to protect state lands rather than blaming the current government for issues related to land mismanagement.His remarks were made during an appearance of the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Samuel Abu Jinapor, at the Government Assurances Committee on Wednesday, July 31, 2024.Mahama emphasised the importance of focusing on practical solutions to safeguard state lands from encroachment and illegal activities.He argued that pointing fingers at the current administration does little to address the underlying issues and instead diverts attention from the necessary actions that need to be taken to protect public assets.He proposed the implementation of robust measures and policies that would ensure the efficient management and protection of state lands.These measures include stricter enforcement of land use regulations, regular monitoring of state properties, and increased transparency in land transactions.Aliu Mahama also said he believes that such steps are crucial for maintaining the integrity of state lands and preventing future mismanagement.""First of all, it is good for us to have the Lands Minister to clarify for us certain issues but let’s be frank, successive governments have had certain gaps in the management of state lands and we should rather focus on how we improve on those gaps and how we solve them rather than pointing figures at the current government over the sale of state lands.""All governments have sold state lands and our focus should be about protecting them and not make it a partisan issue,” he said, a report by myjoyonline.com has said.The MP also highlighted the need for collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, local authorities, and the private sector.He stressed that a collective effort is required to develop and implement effective strategies for land protection.Concluding, Farouk Aliu Mahama urged all parties involved to prioritise the protection of state lands through proactive measures rather than engaging in blame games.AE","Kwasia lands are not for sale,if it was for sale none would have been left by now you are a small boy ,what do you know, your father who was a vice president  had some conscience but not you.Ghana has made a great  mistake,practising democracy has been our downfall to allow boys  with criminal intent to make decisions for us."
Kofi Adams commends Kweku Kwarteng for exposing NPP’s economic mismanagement,"Politics of Wednesday, 31 July 2024","The Member ofParliamentfor Buem, Kofi Adams, has commended Kweku Kwarteng, Chairman of the Finance Committee inParliament, for his candid critique of the government’s management of Ghana’s economy.Speaking on Morning Starr with Lantam Papanko, Mr. Adams indicated that Kwarteng was right when he said the government is managing the economy like a Ponzi scheme.After initially criticizing a tax as a nuisance while in opposition, he outlined how the government decided to float bonds to clear debts more quickly once in power.“They floated the bonds, took the money, and chopped the money. So today, the debt has more than quadrupled. If this is not a Ponzi scheme, what is it? That you raise bonds in the name of ESRA, which has existed. You have the money. The debt was not cleared,” he said.Mr. Kofi Adams also criticized the administration’s tax exemption policies, pointing out instances where companies sought exemptions exceeding their actual investment amounts.“One company came for tax exemption. The amount of money it was asking to be exempted is more than the money it is even investing in the project,” he added.Mr. Adams also noted the significant increase in national debt and the lack of tangible benefits from such borrowing.“They have increased our debt from just 120 billion to 712 billion Ghana cedis in a short period. There’s nothing to show for it apart from a 58-million-dollar hole for a cathedral,” he said.The Buem lawmaker said that despite being part of the ruling party, Kweku Kwarteng has openly addressed the financial issues within the government.“Kweku Kwarteng is right. I respect him for his position on such matters,” he said.Kofi Adams, therefore, urged Ghanaians to vote for a new government that makes practical and meaningful promises.“We are making realistic promises. Promises that will lift Ghana out of its current challenges to a level where everyone benefits,"" he said.Background:A former Deputy Minister for Finance, Kwaku Kwatey, has said Ghana’s economic challenges for years now are the result of economic mismanagement by successive governments.According to him, “we have been running our country’s economy like a Ponzi scheme.”“The economic problems Ghana is facing today, at both the national level and in households, are also the cumulative effects of many decades, spanning different governments, of the bad politics and economic mismanagement that have characterized the governance of our country.""“Since independence, we have survived by constantly overspending our means and borrowing to finance the overspending. And many of these expenditures are just bad priorities.""“We always offer higher interest to lenders, borrow more, use a part to repay previous debts, and use the rest to pay for the current year’s overspending. So, we have been running our country’s economy like a Ponzi scheme. The economy is struggling today because lenders are now refusing to lend to us. It is just like a Ponzi scheme going into crisis once people stop depositing their money with them,"" the Obuasi West lawmaker disclosed in a statement.",Hello youth of Ghana.

Felix Kwakye Ofosu:The former NDC deputy minister stated that the prosecution of the Minority Leader had no basis.He believes it was a ploy to silence Ato Forson for being a critic of the government.“There was never a basis for putting the Minority Leader on trial.

Wherever he has been, in each constituency, Dr. Bawumia lists a number of projects the government has undertaken in the area since 2017, to demonstrate how the NPP has kept faith with the people.On the contrary, Dr. Bawumia has been highlighting how the NDC, under former President Mahama, neglected the north, and rather exploited the north through SADA, which he said was an avenue for corruption, at the expense of the people of the north.In almost every constituency, Dr. Bawumia has challenged former President Mahama to name a SADA project in the constituency.Dr. Bawumia is the first northerner to be elected leader of the NPP in a major election, and for the first time, both the leading candidates for the two leading parties will be from the north.This makes the 2024 election an interesting one, as Dr. Bawumia has made significant inroads in what was previously safe ground for Mahama and the NDC.AM/EKWatch the latest episode of Everyday People on GhanaWeb TV below:",If momentum of campaign crowds are determinant factor in votes then Akufo Addo would have won the 2008 and 2012 elections hands down. Bawumia and NPP can continue bussing people. They have the resources to waste on fake supporting crowds. We have our thumbs. They will see their smoothness levels before 9th December.
